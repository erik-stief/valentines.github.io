        <p class="fade-in">
            Before you start reading this letter I would like to apologize to you for how I acted yesterday.
            I didn't mean to make you feel guilty or let you down. I was in a really bad head space and let that get in the way of enjoying time with you.
            I apologize for the being such a wreck, but don't worry I plan to make this weekend a weekend to remember!
        </p>

            Words seem so inadequate when I try to capture the vastness of my feelings for you, but Valentine's Day, a day dedicated to love, feels like the perfect excuse to try.
            It's a day meant to celebrate love, but honestly, one day feels far too short to truly express the depth of what you mean to me.
            You're not just a valentine, you're the sun in my sky, the moon in my night, the very air that I breathe. You are, quite simply, my everything.
        </p>

            Do you remember that time we went up One Vanderbilt in New York? Thinking about it now, my heart swells with a warmth that spreads through my entire being.
            It's one of my most cherished memories, not just because of what we did, but because of how I felt, how you made me feel. 
            I remember you darting around the tower looking at all of the viewpoints and being amazed… but you also took care of me and made sure I wasn’t uncomfortable with the heights. 
            The fact that I was still at the top of your mind while you were experiencing something new and amazing made me realize something. 
            It was in that moment, or perhaps in a hundred moments just like it, that I knew I was falling, hopelessly and irrevocably, in love with you.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">
            You have this incredible, almost magical ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. You sprinkle stardust on everyday moments and make them shine. 
            You are the light that illuminates my world, chasing away any shadows of doubt or fear.
            You challenge me to grow, to become a better version of myself, not by demanding it, but by simply being you. You inspire me. 
            You support me, even when I stumble, with a love and understanding that I don't deserve but cherish more than anything. 
            And you make me laugh, truly laugh, from the depths of my soul. You make me feel alive, more alive than I've ever felt before.
        </p>

            This Valentine's Day, I want to give you the world, but all I can offer are these words and my unwavering love (As well as some pretty cool gifts and this bomb-ass website). 
            Know that every beat of my heart echoes your name. 
            I love the way your beautiful blue eyes light up when you see me, but even more, I love the depths of your soul, the strength of your spirit, the kindness that radiates from you like sunshine. 
            You are beautiful, inside and out (wink wink), in every way imaginable, and I still can't quite believe that I get to call you mine. I am the luckiest man in the world.
        </p>
        <p class="fade-in">
            I’m so excited to spend this special day with you, creating even more memories to cherish, adding another chapter to our love story. Thank you for being you, for being mine, for being my everything. 
            Thank you for showing me what true love really means. Every day with you feels like Valentine's Day, a celebration of the love that binds us together.
        </p>
